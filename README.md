# circular.js â€” A light weight easy to use MV* JavaScript framework



## Getting Started

 Install the dependencies

### Prerequisites

 - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
 - [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
 - [npm](https://github.com/npm/npm)
 - [bower](http://bower.io/)
 - [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/installing-grunt)

### Clone circular.js

Clone the circular.js repository using [git][git] into a folder with the name of your project:

```
git clone https://github.com/alihaghighatkhah/circular.js.git <your-project-name>
cd <your-project-name>
```

If you just want to start a new project without the circular.js commit history then you can do:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/alihaghighatkhah/circular.js.git <your-project-name>
```

The `depth=1` tells git to only pull down one commit worth of historical data.

### Install Dependencies

We have grunt based node modules dependencies in this project as tools .  The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].

```
npm install
```

You should find that you have a new folder in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
